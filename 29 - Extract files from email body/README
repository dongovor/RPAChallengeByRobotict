Challenge goal:

1. Read the email
2. From this source files: 29_EmailLinkExtraction_SourceFiles.zip either use .msg file and send it to your mailbox (and then use Get Outlook Messages or similar activity)
(OR - in case this somehow cannot work for you - use .html file and read it as text file. In that case: Extract the hyperlinks without opening the html file (act as reading HTML of the Body of the email))
3. search for hyperlinks in the Body of the email (use Regex or any way you will find suitable)
4. identify only those links that lead to .xlsx file (there are few other links in that message too)
5. download Excel file(s) from the link(s) and save in project folder.
